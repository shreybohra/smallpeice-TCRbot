# smallpeice-TCRbot
Code for the winning robot participating the Tin Can Rally challenge in the 2018 Smallpeice trust Computing, Electronics and Robotics course at Southampton University.

The running-code branch contains the code that was actually run on the robot during the competition. This is different to the simulated code due to real world inaccuracies.
